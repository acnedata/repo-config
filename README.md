# Introduction

This repository holds the files neccessary to configure a repository for Python
devlopment in the ACNE Data team.

## Installation and Updating

Installation and updating is a one step process with the following command run from the
root of the repo:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acnedata/repo-config/main/install.sh | bash -s
```

This runs the `install.sh` script in this repository, wich downloads the respective
configuration files into the directory from which it is run. As such we are not
updating configuration files as much as we are reinstalling them with the latest changes.
